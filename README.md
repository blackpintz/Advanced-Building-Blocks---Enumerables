Advanced Building Blocks - Enumerables

## Description

I Implement my own version of twelve of Ruby's enumerable methods. 

Some of the enumerable methods include #each, #map, #select, #none, and #any?.

You can find the list [here](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.6.5/Enumerable.html)

I created a module to  house all the methods.

Check out the live demo to see how my enumerables compare to those of Ruby
